Add the functionality to login into xv6 on start up.
The hard coded accounts are:
user: john
pass: 1234
user: james
pass: pass

use su call to change current user
use au call to add user to auth_passwd.confi file

Currently there are 2 user levels:
0 which is read only access
1 which is read write access.

the only thing that is affected by this is the rm command right now.
